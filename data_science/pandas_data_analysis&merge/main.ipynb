'''# Introduction

Today we'll dive deep into a dataset all about LEGO. From the dataset, we can ask a whole bunch of interesting questions about the history of the LEGO company, their product offerings, and which LEGO set ultimately rules them all:

- What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created, and how many parts did it have?
- How did the LEGO company start out? In which year were the first LEGO sets released, and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?
- Which LEGO theme has the most sets? Is it one of LEGO's own themes like Ninjago or a theme they licensed like Harry Potter or Marvel Superheroes?
- When did the LEGO company really expand its product offering? Can we spot a change in the company strategy based on how many themes and sets it released year-on-year?
- Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets?

**Data Source**

[Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) has compiled data on all the LEGO pieces in existence. I recommend you download the `.csv` files provided in this lesson.

Read the colors.csv file in the data folder and find the total number of unique colours.

# Understanding LEGO Themes vs. LEGO Sets
'''Walk into a LEGO store and you will see their products organised by theme.
Their themes include Star Wars, Batman, Harry Potter and many more.'''
